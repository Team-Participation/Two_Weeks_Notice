# Stage II Goals
### _Feb 7 - 21_

First order of business for everyone is to clean up your existing code.

The original game.js code has been subdivided into separate files based on logical function. These can be found under the optimization branch in Github, which will eventually be merged with the master branch. Create your own fork/branch for your work. Refer to Sohaib for Github related questions.

Deadline for Stage II code submission will be Sunday Feb. 19 so that assembly and debugging of full build can take place on the Monday before class.

We will reconvene to debrief and plan Stage III on Feb. 21.

__Bolded__ names will act as team coordinators.

### Team addEventListener
__Chris__, Felix, Prem, Jordan

Implement Inventory  
* item/environment interaction  

Implement Dialogue/Textboxes  
Finalize UI  
Consolidate and remove redundancies from Stage I


### Team LevelUp
__Sohaib__, Brandon, Pedro, Ryan (if needed)

Transition support between level screens  
Shell for all 4 game screens  
Framework for level editing
* 2D array with number codes for tileset
* Use for obstacle and bgtile draw layers (see existing code)
* ^This is to simplify collision mapping
* ^Interactable part of obstacles like watercooler will move into special array


### Team Comp. Bombparty
Ryan, John

Rendering  
Assembly  
Optimization


### Misc.
John

Storyboard  
* event tree
* write dialogue  

Borrow assets

# Stage I Plan Review

## How your design or plan has changed since the end of last semester:

* We came up with a completely new game idea and plan

## Identify any potential risks and propose solutions:

* Scope of new game is ambitious; risk of biting off more than can chew
* Solution is to stay on the ball; have frequent milestones

## List any roadblocks that are preventing the team from making progress and explain how you are going to overcome them:

* None so far

# Critical Stage Analysis


## What are five things that went right during this past development period?

1. We met all our milestone goals for first playable
2. All group members were filled with determination, and competence
3. All group members engaged in _team participation_
4. Dividing group into production teams was effective for distributing work
5. Nobody got hurt


## What are five things that went wrong during this past development period?

1. Coordination between teams could be better; proper use of github not yet adopted
2. Code was sometimes written redundantly by multiple teams due to coordination issues; could be better optimized
3. Work by teams requiring another team's completed code was sometimes delayed until prerequisite code was completed
4. Milestones of group may need to be even further ahead of class schedule in order to achieve scope of project
5. Insufficient time to fully debug everyone's code


## What are five things that can be improved for future development periods?

1. Get everyone on board with github
2. Improve team coordination by having weekly milestone meetings in class; more micromanagement
3. Implement some of the production methodologies from Game Production I; Have frequent sprint milestones in order to make sure scope of project is realized by end of development period
4. Emphasize intermediate deadlines for teams whose work is required by another team (ie; debugging)
5. Make sure every team has a member with more experience to provide guidance
6. Use more concept sketches to convey desired execution of ideas to teams
