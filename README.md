Changes since Alpha:
<br><br>
New assets
<br>
New map framework
<br>
Walk animation (needs minor tweaks)
<br>
All interactions changed to call target associated methods (allows easy customization of effects through polymorphism)
<br>
Implemented power of Farhang to game objects
<br>
New dialogue function as part of improving npc and gameobject framework
<br>
replaced timedText with dismiss on any input (works for all text prompts)
<br>
removed all old redundant code I came across
<br>
npc rendering currently offline pending changes (clicking still works)
<br>
<br>
textboxes need to be changed to handle more than 1 line, and also be placed over the main canvas (top or bottom, like typical jrpg)
