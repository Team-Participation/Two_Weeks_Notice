# Plan Review

## How your design or plan has changed since the end of last semester:

⋅⋅* We came up with a completely new game idea and plan

## Identify any potential risks and propose solutions:

⋅⋅* Scope of new game is ambitious; risk of biting off more than can chew
⋅⋅* Solution is to stay on the ball; have frequent milestones

## List any roadblocks that are preventing the team from making progress and explain how you are going to overcome them:

⋅⋅* None so far

# Critical Stage Analysis


## What are five things that went right during this past development period?

⋅⋅1. We met all our milestone goals for first playable
⋅⋅2. All group members were filled with determination, and competence
⋅⋅3. All group members engaged in _team participation_
⋅⋅4. Dividing group into production teams was effective for distributing work
⋅⋅5. Nobody got hurt


## What are five things that went wrong during this past development period?

⋅⋅1. Coordination between teams could be better; proper use of github not yet adopted
⋅⋅2. Code was sometimes written redundantly by multiple teams due to coordination issues; could be better optimized
⋅⋅3. Work by teams requiring another team's completed code was sometimes delayed until prerequisite code was completed
⋅⋅4. Milestones of group may need to be even further ahead of class schedule in order to achieve scope of project
⋅⋅5. Insufficient time to fully debug everyone's code


## What are five things that can be improved for future development periods?

⋅⋅1. Get everyone on board with github
⋅⋅2. Improve team coordination by having weekly milestone meetings in class; more micromanagement
⋅⋅3. Implement some of the production methodologies from Game Production I; Have frequent sprint milestones in order to make sure scope of project is realized by end of development period
⋅⋅4. Emphasize intermediate deadlines for teams whose work is required by another team (ie; debugging)
⋅⋅5. Make sure every team has a member with more experience to provide guidance
⋅⋅6. Use more concept sketches to convey desired execution of ideas to teams
